# For the Monte Carlo sim I have decided to use most up to date data - so 5 years from last week. 
# With the Retirement Planning it is important to note that compounding is the key and that it takes time
# this means that trying to short cut the process means that you miss out on compound opportunities.
# We are looking at a comparison of retirement planning for a normal working life ie say 30 years vs bringing forward, ie 5-10 years
# as such we are trying to address the tradeoff between compounding over time vs, making up for lost time. It is difficult to make up for lost time, ie compound growth needs to be your friend.
